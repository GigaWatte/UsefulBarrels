description=[h3]Mods compatibility[/h3]
description=In general, all other mods that in any way modify vanilla context options for FluidContainers can replace UB context options and after that it leads to unpredictable behaviour.
description=For example: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3406674803]Plumbing Expanded[/url].
description=If you have any issues with barrels and have similar mod then try to change mod load order and move Useful Barrels mod at the bottom as much as you can. It should remain other mods functional as well as UB works as intended.

description=[h3] Known bugs [/h3]
description=[list]
description=    [*]Barrel is not persisting the Gas if placed in locations located far away from vanilla (x:20000+) but I can not reproduce this issue, needs more information.
description=    [*]Infinite Gas when pumped out all Gas. Still cant reproduce it, needs more info as well.
description=    [*]If you used mod before B42.4 there can be an error while calling context menu on the barrel. PickUp action then Place may resolve it.Or repalce the barrel with entire new one you dont used before. (It looks like internal Java code error but I am not sure)
