title=[B42] Useful Barrels
description=Barrels can actually be more than just a sprite!
description=
description=!!! Important:
description=For now Barrel technically can store other liquids than Gas that can be added via various context options but using mod context option pouring out is always the Gas. 
description=I want to rewrite this logic so that the barrel can store and properly work with any type of fluid. 
description=The main problem is that in Lua I can add an amount of specific fluid but I can not remove an amount of specific fluid due to no appropriate method available.
description=This is the reason of current restrictions for gas-only operations. 
description=I'm still trying to find a workaround.
description=
description=Features:
description=- Use your Pipe Wrench to open the lid of the barrel
description=- Uses new FluidContainer system of b42
description=- The amount of liquid inside the barrel affects the encumberance
description=- Rubber Hose to take Gas from barrel
description=- Funnel for pouring Gas into the barrel
description=- Funnel may speedup pouring action
description=- Sandbox variables to control mod behaviour as you want (capacity, tools requirement and bonus modifiers)
description=
description=Notes:
description=- Is safe to add in existing saves as well as removing, FuidContainer will remain.
description=- Barrels will be empty initially.
description=- Currently there is no options to refuel generator or vehicle directly. I'll try to add that in the future.
description=- Barrel can be plumbed when placed under Rain Collector Barrel/Crate. I'm still thinking about what to do with it. I'll leave it as is for now.
description=
description=WIP:
description=- Storing any type of fluid
description=- Refueling generator from Barrel
description=- Add Base.MetalDrum as Barrel for storing Gas
description=- More translations
description=
description=Future plans:
description=- Randomized initial fluid and amount in new Barrel with sandbox vars control
description=
description=Known bugs:
description=- Barrel can be filled while equipped in hand slot. Unequip it to be able to place on ground.
description=- Got reports that Barrel is not persisting the Gas if placed in locations located far away from vanilla (x:20000+) but I can not reproduce this issue. Still needs to be checked.
description=- Got reports about infinite Gas when pumped out all Gas. Trying to figure out it.
