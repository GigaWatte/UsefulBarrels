TODO crashes may not save fluidContainer
TODO get pipe wrench from nested inventory container
TODO refuel from gas station
the thing is it lets you transfer gas from a vehicle without a rubber hose, only that the fuel does not end up in the barrel. So technically, you shouldn't be able to get the fuel out of the car without a hose. Other than that everything seems to work just fine, thanks. :)
